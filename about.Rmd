title: "Who we are"
---

We are R Users from in and around Zurich. We hold Meetups, which you can see 
[here](http://www.meetup.com/Zurich-R-User-Group/).

Right now Heidi Seibold, Muriel Buri and Christoph Molnar are the Organisers.

The source code for the website can be found [here](). 
It is based on [RMarkdown website examples](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown-website-examples)
and was quite easy to publish thanks to [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).
