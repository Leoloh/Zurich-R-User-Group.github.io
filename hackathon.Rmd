title: "Open Data Day Hackathon"
---

You want to improve public transport of your city? You know how to wrangle,
analyse, visualise or communicate data? Then this hackathon is for you!

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("ggmap")
zrh <- get_map(location = "Zurich", zoom = 12, source="stamen", maptype="toner")
ggmap(zrh)
```


Toghether with 
[Open Data Zurich](https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/opendata) and
[VBZ](https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/vbz/en/index.html) 
we are planning planning a hackathon for the 

**Open Data Day on Saturday March 4th 2017**.

The event will include time for hacking but we will also invite some speakers
for talks. Food and drinks will be provided. All you have to bring is your
laptop.

You do not need to be a data science superhero yet. It is completely fine if you 
have basic skills in **one** of the following:

- Combining and cleaning data sets
- Creating graphs and visualisations
- Creating statistics or models
- Creating slides, documents, websites or anything else to communicate the results

For analysis you can use *any open data* you like. VBZ provides *transport delay* 
and *passenger count* data via the [Zurich Open Data Portal](). The goal is it to
use open source software (such as R) to get interesting new insights and share 
them with the world. 


More details will follow soon...
