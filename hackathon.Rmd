You want to improve public transport of your city? You know how to wrangle and
analyse data? Then this hackathon is for you!

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("ggmap")
zrh <- get_map(location = "Zurich", zoom = 12, source="stamen", maptype="toner")
ggmap(zrh)
```


Toghether with 
[Open Data Zurich](https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/) and
[VBZ](https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/vbz/en/index.html) 
we are planning planning a hackathon for the 

**Open Data Day on Saturday March 4th 2017**.

The event will include time for hacking but we will also invite some speakers
for talks. Food and drinks will be provided. All you have to bring is your
laptop.
